eForth Development Module Journal

This module represents a work in progress, not a release area.

Changes are made here without regard to any client's needs.

It is used to checkpoint work and to integrate collaborative
work from multiple sources.

In general things are not checked in unless they have been
tested and are known to work, although the level of testing need
not be rigorous but functional.

There may be exceptions to this when agreed to by the members of
a collaboration as convenient.

This file will attempt to discuss the purpose and goals of
changes and progress.

Do not depend upon this as a complete statement and do not
expect this code to fix anything unless you are told so.

It is far more likely that using this code will break something
you depend upon without warning.

Releases are never found here, at least not on the main branch.
In general releases are posted to the wiki, web or emails.

----------------------------------------------------------------
20080713-09xx
This initial check in is the 20080709 version that was sent to
Anser
----------------------------------------------------------------
20080713-11xx
these changes are to improve the serial terminal code so that it
can handle different USB Serial Adapters.

The main issue seems to be the slope of the bit transistions: by
changing from timing a single 1-bit (rising-edge to rising-edge)
to timing both the 1-bit and following 0-bits (rising-edge to
rising-edge) the disparate loop-counts matched!

Changed the start-up back to autobaud (requires spacebar press
to get startup message and 'ok' prompt).
----------------------------------------------------------------
20080714-2354
Finally getting the day's changes into cvs: this time it's for

1) serial terminal testing
2) editorial cleanups
3) shifting okad blocks so Greg's redaction blocks go where he
   wanted
----------------------------------------------------------------
20080720-19xx

1) did more serial terminal fixing and tweaking on both ends of
   the cable--was a little off-center in start bit and needed
   more host delay during first word (FILE) of file transfers.
   Also made the demo files a bit more consistent.
2) added neighbor-node access to eForth (includes IDE)
3) updated the ventureforth files to match the working
   colorforth code
4) added some text to the readme file.
----------------------------------------------------------------
20080818-1238
Move eForth base address to himem (H# 20000) using colorForth
IDE
----------------------------------------------------------------
20080823-1300
VentureForth IDE will now compile eForth himem model
----------------------------------------------------------------
20080929-0930
e4xram.vf and e4core.vf were moved to */e4 from */e4dist/e4docs.

Dual-access paged SDRAM is working under both ColorForth and
VentureForth IDEs.

There's a short description of paged access in
e4dist/eforth/user.e4 and the sdram details are in e4/e4xram.vf
----------------------------------------------------------------
200800930-1100
included bank bits in paging, increasing pages from 32 to 128
(16MW)
----------------------------------------------------------------
200801108-2100
1) changed sdram control from chip-select to NOP-command to free
   a pin for DM, allowing expansion to 32MW (requires wiring
   change to the first 7j boards).
2) factor the sdram code into a separate project (serial soon
   also)
3) move e4dist folder up a level (out of projects folder)
3) After it was working in VentureForth, ported back to
   ColorForth/OKAD
----------------------------------------------------------------
